<p><strong>Project Description</strong>
</p>
</td>
<td rowspan="1" colspan="1">
<p>An Environmental Study was commissioned by Sentosa Development Corporation
(SDC) in July 2020 for the proposed Deep Gravity Sewers project at Sentosa
(hereinafter referred to as the “Project”).</p>
<p></p>
<p>This Project would involve the implementation of a pure gravitational
Deep Gravity Sewers (hereinafter referred to as “DGS”) system on Sentosa
to replace the island’s existing aging sewer network.</p>
<p></p>
<p>The DGS system would be more efficient, reliable, and sustainable as a
long-term solution for the next 100 years, in line with PUB’s implementation
of the Deep Tunnel Sewerage System (DTSS).</p>

<p><strong>Environmental Study Summary</strong>
</p>
</td>
<td rowspan="1" colspan="1">
<p>Following a preliminary assessment on the entire proposed DGS system,
it was discussed with Technical Agencies that the key focus of the Environmental
Study would be for above-ground construction worksites near identified
Nature Areas (i.e., Mount Imbiah and Mount Serapong), as there would unlikely
be environmental impacts during its underground operations.</p>
<p></p>
<p>The summary of impact significance (with minimum controls) and the potential
residual impact significance (after considering mitigation measures for
moderate and major impact significance) for the construction phase are
presented in the following table.</p>
