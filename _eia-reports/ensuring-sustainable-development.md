   Being Asia’s leading leisure destination, Sentosa is known for its diverse array of unique leisure experiences today, ranging from themed attractions, dining offerings and accommodation options to beaches and nature trails. As we move into the next phase of our development, we will build on this strong position to rejuvenate our offerings, including the rolling out the Sentosa-Brani Master Plan which will redevelop the two islands into a game-changing leisure and tourism destination. 
  </p>
  <p style="text-align: justify;">
    An integral design principle of these plans is on sustainable development. Even as we refresh our offerings amid changing guest preferences and needs, we remain firmly committed to environmental sustainability and protecting our island charm, and will ensure that the plans are sensitive and authentic to our rich natural and cultural heritage.
  </p>
  <p>
    To ensure that development works are done in an environmentally sound manner, SDC and our Island Partners (tenants) will adhere to developmental guidelines for sensitive areas. Environmental Impact Assessments (EIA) are undertaken prior to developmental works in proximity to or within sensitive areas. The purpose of these assessments, which are conducted by independent consultants, is to identify, evaluate, and where necessary, mitigate the possible impacts from these works as well as identify suitable enhancement measures to provide added benefits.
  </p>
  <p>
    The EIA process is conducted in consultation with stakeholders such as nature groups, technical agencies and relevant Government agencies. The EIA Reports published are open for public feedback for 4 weeks starting from the date of publication. We welcome your feedback at
