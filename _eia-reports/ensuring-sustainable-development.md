<p>Being Asia’s leading leisure destination, Sentosa is known for its diverse
array of unique leisure experiences today, ranging from themed attractions,
dining offerings and accommodation options to beaches and nature trails.
As we move into the next phase of our development, we will build on this
strong position to rejuvenate our offerings, including the rolling out
the Greater Sentosa Master Plan (formerly known as Sentosa-Brani Master
Plan) which will redevelop the two islands into a game-changing leisure
and tourism destination.</p>
<p>An integral design principle of these plans is on sustainable development.
Even as we refresh our offerings amid changing guest preferences and needs,
we remain firmly committed to environmental sustainability and protecting
our island charm, and will ensure that the plans are sensitive and authentic
to our rich natural and cultural heritage.</p>
<p>To ensure that development works are done in an environmentally sound
manner, SDC and our Island Partners (tenants) will adhere to developmental
guidelines for sensitive areas. Environmental Impact Assessments (EIA)
are undertaken prior to developmental works in proximity to or within sensitive
areas. The purpose of these assessments, which are conducted by independent
consultants, is to identify, evaluate, and where necessary, mitigate the
possible impacts from these works as well as identify suitable enhancement
measures to provide added benefits.</p>
<p>The EIA process is conducted in consultation with stakeholders such as
nature groups, technical agencies and relevant Government agencies. The
EIA Reports published are open for public feedback for 4 weeks starting
from the date of publication. We welcome your feedback at <a href="mailto:sustainability@sentosa.com.sg" rel="noopener noreferrer nofollow" target="_blank">sustainability@sentosa.com.sg</a>
