### How It Works

Sentosa X Enterprise offers a win-win partnership, where innovators and enterprises benefit from a risk-sharing arrangement while working on projects that could boost Sentosa's vibrancy and attractiveness.

Sentosa island is being offered as a testbed venue to innovators and enterprises to bring innovative or novel ideas, concepts or technology that require proof-of-concept.

In addition to facilitation support, proposals will be reviewed for eligibility for funding under relevant government schemes, subject to criteria and qualifying costs.
