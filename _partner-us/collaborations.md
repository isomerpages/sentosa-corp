### **Inter-Agency Collaborations**

Beyond building the island as a fun destination for all, SDC is committed to building a Smart and Sustainable Sentosa, leveraging new technologies and solutions to continuously enhance guest experience, and ensure the sustainable development of the island. To this end, SDC has embarked on several collaborations with other agencies, including the Infocomm & Media Development Authority and Ministry of Transport, to create and test-bed new technologies and solutions.
