### **Developing a Sustainable Leisure and Tourism Destination**
SDC strives to develop the resort island as a leading leisure and tourism destination in a sustainable manner. While the past few decades have seen rapid changes to the island with extensive development works, many parts of Sentosa still retain the original tranquil and green environment.

This is because SDC has adopted a balanced and sustainable approach to the development and growth of Sentosa and constant attention has been paid to protecting the greenery, heritage and island charm

	<div class="col is-6">
		<p>
			To raise awareness for marine conservation and to encourage such efforts, 26 marine interest groups, conservation and research organisations including Our Singapore Reefs and Celebrating Singapore Shores linked up with SDC to jointly celebrate the third International Year of the Reef in Sentosa. 
			<br />
		</p>
	</div>
</div>
<p>
	Held at the Palawan Pirate Ship from 17 to 18 March 2018, The Fun Odyssea was a free celebratory event that offered insights into Singapore’s shores, marine biodiversity and environmental issues through hands-on activities, interactive booths, and movie screenings. 
	<br />
	The opening ceremony was graced by Guest-of-Honour, Mr Andrew Tan, Chief Executive of Maritime and Port Authority of Singapore. Guests at the event also had the chance to sign up for the free guided intertidal tours to the unique Siloso Headland, which is home to corals, seagrass, and a wide variety of marine life. 
</p>

#### **Protecting Endangered Hawksbill Turtles**

	</div>
	<div class="col is-6">
      <p>
	  	SDC is proud to have played a key role in contributing to the world’s population of endangered Hawksbill turtles! Following the discovery of a nest at Tanjong Beach in November 2017, various measures were put in place to ensure the safety of the Hawksbill turtle nest, to protect the eggs from natural predators like monitor lizards and crabs. SDC further worked closely with the National Parks Board to monitor the eggs daily during their incubation period.
	  </p>
	</div>
</div>
<p>
	In January 2018, 111 endangered hawksbill turtles emerged from the nest and made their way into the waters!
	<br />
	Later on in the same year, another batch of 102 eggs hatched at Tanjong Beach in September 2018, about two months after the eggs were first found.

	<div class="col is-6">
		<p>
			With 40 hectares of protected nature areas, more than 20 heritage trees, over 100 recorded bird species, and a variety of walking and cycling trails on the island, Sentosa is a haven for nature lovers. To bring guests closer to the island’s hidden gems, a slew of free nature activities was launched over the year, including the inaugural Siloso Headland Intertidal Programme.
		</p>
	</div>
</div>
<p>
	The guided programme explores Tanjong Rimau – one of Singapore’s last remaining coastal cliffs and rocky shores. Home to corals, seagrass and a wide variety of marine wildlife, Tanjong Rimau also boasts beautiful landscapes with an original and ageold rock outcrop.

			Singapore’s only fully-restored fort, Fort Siloso, and over 30 conserved buildings are found on the island. Pre-war buildings and unique structures are re-purposed to give a second lease of life. Some buildings were built by the British and date back to the late 1800s. Similarly, some of our iconic but defunct Sentosa monorail stations have been converted into hotels, restaurants, attractions and offices.

			To mark World Water Day on 22 March 2018, the island’s iconic landmarks such as the Sentosa Merlion, Sentosa Gateway Towers, Resorts World Sentosa and Sentosa Boardwalk, were lit up in blue as a show of Sentosa’s commitment towards water sustainability and its support for water conservation. The United Nations has designated 22 March as World Water Day to focus global attention on the importance of water, a critical resource that should be cherished and protected.

	</div>
</div>
<p>
	The advent of green design has highlighted methods in minimising the damage dealt to the environment through various architectural and design solutions. Many of Sentosa’s buildings are Green Mark certified, which is awarded by Singapore’s Building and Construction Authority (BCA) to environmentally-friendly buildings.
	<br />
	In particular, the Sentosa Express clinched the Special Award (Public Infrastructure) at the 2017 Skyrise Greenery Awards. Conferred by the National Parks Board, the award recognises the innovative vertical greenwall system that is incorporated into the pillars of the Sentosa Express train track along the Sentosa Gateway. The vertical greenwall reduces the urban heat effect and blends in seamlessly with Sentosa's lush greenery and tropical environment, while also enhancing the biodiversity of the island.

<p>
	In 2018, NYK and MTI Co. Ltd. reached an agreement to participate in a long-term demonstration of tidal energy that is sponsored by MAKO Energy Pte. Ltd. and SDC. This is the first demonstration of tidal energy to be undertaken in Singapore. MAKO Turbines installed under the Sentosa Boardwalk enables the testing of power generation efficiency, the cost of power generation and storage for a period of two years.

	We educate students and the wider public about Sentosa’s sustainability efforts, as well as ensure that underprivileged Singaporeans have the opportunity to experience the island’s leisure offerings. Since 2011, the island community has come together in our “Sentosa Gives” initiative annually to welcome beneficiaries from various Voluntary Welfare Organisations and charities in Singapore, with beneficiaries treated to a day of fun and activities on Sentosa.
