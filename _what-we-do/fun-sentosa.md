### **Unique Leisure Experiences**
Catering to a variety of interests, Sentosa’s development plans are carved out into different zones, each with its unique characteristics and tailored to the diverse needs of our guests. SDC also continues to strengthen Sentosa’s ‘always on’ calendar of events to create year-round buzz for guests to discover themselves through distinct and fulfilling offerings. From festive celebrations to signature events such as Sentosa Food Fest, and Zentosa Fest, we aim give our visitors more reasons to discover themselves and the island afresh, on every visit.

SDC continues to enhance infrastructural developments to strengthen mobility and connectivity across the island, as well as between Sentosa and the mainland. These efforts are aimed at catering to the growing visitorship and to provide a more comfortable travelling experience for guests.

Sentosa’s on-island cable car line, located at the western part of Sentosa, opened in 2015. The Sentosa Line of the Singapore Cable Car Sky Network not only provides a scenic view over Siloso Beach and Mount Imbiah, it also enhances accessibility for visitors within the island.

In addition, SBS Transit’s Service 123 was extended to Sentosa’s Beach Station, while the Sentosa Gateway Tunnel opened in 2017, strengthening inter-island connectivity.
To provide visitors with weather protection, a sheltered linkway also links Beach Station to Palawan Beach and Tanjong Beach

As Singapore progresses towards a ‘car-lite’ society, Sentosa has also introduced cycling tracks and walking trails across the island, with future plans to broaden the transport network to include the introduction of self-driving on-demand point-to-point shuttle services.
