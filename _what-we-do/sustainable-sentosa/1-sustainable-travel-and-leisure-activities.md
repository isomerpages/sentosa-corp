### **Sustainable Travel and Leisure Activities**
		
With 40 hectares of protected nature areas, more than 20 heritage trees, over 100 recorded bird species, and a variety of walking and cycling trails on the island, Sentosa is a haven for nature lovers.

To bring guests closer to the island’s hidden gems, a slew of immersive nature activities was launched over the years, including the Siloso Headland Intertidal Programme and nature bathing tours.

In 2020 Sentosa also launched Singapore's first carbon neutral beers. The Sentosa Islander Brew is a series of four beers made in collaboration with Brewerkz, a local craft brewery. Each beer is inspired by a unique Sentosa experience – Island Life, Nature Adventure, Heritage Discovery, and Wellness Escape – so guests can #MakeTime for a holiday anywhere. 
		
Sentosa island is not just a resort destination but a living classroom too. Home to historical sites, nature trails and wildlife, we hope to partner with educators to leverage on Sentosa's uniqueness and add a twist to existing structured curriculum.  By 2022, guests can look forward to the launch of sustainability-themed tours that aim to increase the appreciation and protection of nature, biodiversity, and heritage on Sentosa. The Southern Islands experiences will also be launched with Sentosa as a conduit to the archipelago.

Guests can also look forward to experiencing more leisure experiences with a low carbon footprint, enabled through unique and sustainable off-grid offerings powered by 100% renewable energy.

### **Heritage Conservation** 
As custodians of the island, SDC has the responsibility to protect its cultural assets through heritage conservation. These assets also serve to educate both local and overseas guests on the historical significance of Sentosa, including its military past which is still present throughout the island.

SDC’s approach to heritage conservation includes the restoration of old buildings and injection of vibrancy into old building structures. By conserving the historical assets on the island, SDC managed to open free public access to the last preserved coastal Fort in Singapore and other new initiatives. SDC will continue to embark on heritage preservation efforts while keeping public safety in mind.

Recognising that Sentosa’s heritage is only a part of a larger historical narrative, SDC has collaborated with other museums, heritage agencies and relevant stakeholders to host joint-exhibitions and events, as we uncover Singapore’s history together.

### **Social Inclusivity and Local Communities** 
Ensuring social and economic sustainability is also key to meeting the needs of the current generation and providing support to the needs of future generations. Acknowledging the economic hardships caused by COVID-19, SDC places a strong emphasis on promoting social inclusivity by supporting local Social Service Organisations (SSOs) in outreach and engagement efforts for underprivileged and elderly beneficiaries, as well as promoting volunteerism values among SDC’s staff and Island Partners.

SDC has established three-year partnerships with Care Corner Singapore and TOUCH Community Services. Under the Care Corner partnership, the SwiTCH UP! Programme aims to support adolescents in developing stress coping abilities and instilling positive values, leadership competencies and social awareness. 

SDC has also partnered with Glyph Asia, whose main beneficiaries are children from less privileged families. As part of this collaboration, SDC conducted a series of 24 weekend art and craft classes with Glyph’s beneficiaries to upcycle 10,000 pieces of waste materials from SDC's National Day celebrations into drawstring bags. Staff volunteers also shared about environmental protection and the need to reduce waste, in an effort to imbue in the minds of the children the importance of sustainability.

SDC will continue to promote volunteerism among all staff and initiate new community activities to not only help grow a heart for volunteerism among SDC’s staff, but also engage more to be involved in volunteering activities.
