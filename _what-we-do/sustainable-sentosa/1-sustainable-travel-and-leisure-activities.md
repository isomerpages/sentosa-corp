### **Sustainable Travel and Leisure Activities**
		
With 40 hectares of protected nature areas, more than 20 heritage trees, 474 species of flora and fauna, and a variety of walking and cycling trails on the island, Sentosa is a haven for nature lovers.

To bring guests closer to the island’s hidden gems, a slew of immersive tours were launched over the years, including the Siloso Headland Intertidal Programme and SentoSights - a series of unique guided tours, for guests to gain insights into the importance of sustainability and conservation, as they discover the island's nature and heritage.

In 2020, Sentosa also launched Singapore's first carbon neutral beers. The Sentosa Islander Brew is a series of four beers made in collaboration with Brewerkz, a local craft brewery. Each beer is inspired by a unique Sentosa experience – Island Life, Nature Adventure, Heritage Discovery, and Wellness Escape – so guests can&nbsp;#MakeTime for a holiday&nbsp;anywhere. 
		
### **Heritage Conservation** 
As custodians of the island, SDC has the responsibility to protect its cultural assets through heritage conservation. These assets also serve to educate both local and overseas guests on the historical significance of Sentosa, including its military past which is still present throughout the island.

SDC’s approach to heritage conservation includes the restoration of old buildings and injection of vibrancy into old building structures. Home to over 24 conserved buildings and Singapore’s only fully restored fort, Sentosa remains an important landmark in Singapore’s history. SDC believes that the history of Sentosa serves as an intangible treasure that SDC has the responsibility to preserve as well as educate both local and overseas guests on.

In partnership with NHB, the Sentosa Heritage Trail was launched in March 2022, comprising three themed routes and supplemented with heritage trail markers to allow guests to explore the island in their own time. The trails uncover the stories and history of the early settlers on the island, shed light on the story of modern Sentosa’s reinvention and trace the transformation of the island from a military complex to a leisure destination.

Recognising that Sentosa’s heritage is only a part of a larger historical narrative, SDC has collaborated with other museums, heritage agencies and relevant stakeholders to host joint-exhibitions and events, as we uncover Singapore’s history together. 

### **Social Inclusivity and Local Communities** 
Ensuring social and economic sustainability is also key to meeting the needs of the current generation and providing support to the needs of future generations. SDC has developed the Sentosa Cares Framework, with the following objectives:
- To position SDC and Island Partners as choice employers who support inclusive hiring for persons-with-disabilities and low-income families, and build an inclusive and caring organisation culture.
- To enhance Sentosa with inclusive experiences for guests with all abilities to enjoy and discover.

SDC has established three-year partnerships with Care Corner Singapore and TOUCH Community Services. Under the Care Corner partnership, the SwiTCH UP! Programme aims to support adolescents in developing stress coping abilities and instilling positive values, leadership competencies and social awareness. 

SDC has also partnered with Glyph Asia, whose main beneficiaries are children from less privileged families. As part of this collaboration, SDC conducted a series of 24 weekend art and craft classes with Glyph’s beneficiaries&nbsp;to upcycle 10,000 pieces of waste materials from SDC's National Day celebrations into drawstring bags. Staff volunteers also shared about environmental protection and the need to reduce waste, in an effort to imbue in the minds of the children the importance of sustainability.

SDC will continue to promote volunteerism among all staff and initiate new community activities to not only help grow a heart for volunteerism among SDC’s staff, but also engage more to be involved in volunteering activities.
