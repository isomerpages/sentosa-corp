### **Decarbonisation and Closing the Waste Loop**
		
SDC is working towards reducing its energy intensity and greenhouse gas emissions, to ensure that Sentosa continues to develop as a sustainable leisure destination. We will support our Island Partners on decarbonisation initiatives, track Sentosa’s carbon emissions, trial new solutions, as well as work together with guests, the island community and technology partners to meet its collective climate goals.

To understand the overall carbon profile of Sentosa and what decarbonisation measures and solutions can be most efficiently deployed, SDC has been involved in a study with Temasek since June 2021. Beyond decarbonisation  measures and solutions, SDC will also support the island’s businesses on sourcing of credible and quality carbon offsets. 

While SDC’s share of Sentosa’s overall carbon footprint is estimated to be only between 6% to 8%, SDC is in a privileged position where we can influence the island’s carbon profile as its master planner, landlord, precinct operator, brand ambassador and custodian of Sentosa. 

Singapore’s first carbon neutrality-driven business alliance, the Sentosa Carbon Neutral Network (SCNN), was established in this regard. This is a collective public-private effort to achieve Sentosa’s sustainability goals, including carbon neutrality by 2030. Together, SDC and the network of industry players will develop Sentosa-wide sustainability solutions through the sharing of resources and expertise, while also leveraging economies of scale and a common network to introduce large-scale solutions. 

These efforts include the development of green MICE offerings, sustainable events, as well as guidelines for reducing disposables. SDC will also collaborate with the Singapore Food Agency (SFA) to increase the use of locally-sourced produce across Sentosa’s hotels and restaurants. Meanwhile, in addition to implementing various initiatives with the potential to reduce carbon emissions by up to 30% compared with 2019 baselines, SCNN will invest in credible carbon offsets and imported renewable energy to neutralise the remaining carbon profile.

Established in September 2021, the network comprises 17 founding members, including SDC and major businesses in Sentosa: Amara Sanctuary Resort Sentosa, Capella Hotel Singapore, C Side (Bikini Bar, Coastes and Sand Bar), Far East Hospitality Management Singapore, FOC Sentosa, Madame Tussauds Singapore, Mount Faber Leisure, Ola Beach Club, Resorts World Sentosa, Rumours Beach Club, Sentosa Golf Club, Scentopia, Shangri-La Rasa Sentosa, Siloso Beach Resort, Tanjong Beach Club and W Singapore-Sentosa Cove. 

Collectively, these members account for more than 90% of the island’s estimated carbon profile, thus potentially bringing about the largest reductions in Sentosa’s carbon emissions. The formation of the network follows Sentosa’s island-wide carbon profiling initiative, which began in 2020, to establish Sentosa’s island carbon profile baseline and guide future carbon mitigation and abatement efforts.

#### **Waste Management**
To encourage guests to recycle and empower guests to adopt an eco-conscious lifestyle, SDC has collaborated with the National Environment Agency (NEA) to roll out smart Reverse Vending Machines (RVMs) which reward guests for recycling their drink containers (aluminium cans or plastic bottles). Guests  will be able to redeem a Free Sentosa Fun Pass (5 tokens) for every 10 drink containers recycled. The main goal of test-bedding the RVMs at Sentosa is to encourage guests to do their part for the environment and cultivate a habit a recycling.

Since July 2021, Sentosa Golf Club has been test-bedding an on-site food waste digestor, which generates non-portable water or compost while reducing the amount of food waste generated.

Disposables make up a significant amount of SDC’s total waste. As such, SDC recognises the importance of implementing new initiatives within the Group to play a part in minimising the number of disposables used. For example, at SDC’s Human Resource department, disposable water bottles are not provided during internal staff events or meetings conducted. 

In addition to reducing disposables internally, it is also important to encourage guests to reduce waste and adopt a more environmentally conscious lifestyle. To reduce the amount of waste generated at Sentosa, SDC has pledged to reduce food wastage and the use of disposables by supporting the National Environment Agency (NEA)’s “Say Yes to Waste Less” Campaign. Through this campaign, SDC aims to create a more sustainable future by encouraging all Island Partners to adopt and implement the campaign on their premises, as well as at the Group’s own operations to encourage guests to cultivate a habit of reducing food wastage and using lesser disposables. For example, at Sentosa Golf Club’s food and beverages establishments, disposables such as one-time use utensils and plastic bottles are not provided to all guests. Water stations are accessible for all to use instead.
