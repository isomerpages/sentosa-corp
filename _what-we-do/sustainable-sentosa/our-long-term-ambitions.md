### **Our Ambitions**
The Sentosa community will focus on six key areas to achieve the island's dual goals of achieving carbon neutrality by 2030 and becoming a globally recognised, certified sustainable tourism destination.

In 2022, SDC was conferred the Global Sustainable Tourism Council – For Destinations (GSTC-D) certificate, affirming the organisation’s strong push for collective and collaborative whole-of-island efforts towards achieving a more sustainable Sentosa.
