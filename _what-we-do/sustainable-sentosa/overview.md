### **Overview**
The Sustainable Sentosa Framework was established to serve as one of SDC’s key strategic thrusts. The framework promotes sustainability across SDC and its subsidiaries’ operations, in line with national sustainability initiatives to mitigate climate-related risks. The Sustainable Sentosa Framework sits alongside other strategic imperatives, including SDC’s commitment to guest satisfaction and ensuring their wellbeing and safety, while creating a vibrant island economy and a nurturing and safe working environment for all staff.

#### **Our Vision**
&gt; An internationally recognised resort island that offers an inspiring sustainable development model that enables and furthers Singapore’s national sustainability and climate change outcomes.

We also recognise the need to build networks to capitalise on synergies to advance mutual interests in sustainability. Through forming meaningful partnerships we can build a Sustainable Sentosa community to punch above our weight in terms of impact and influence. 

We believe that the supporting strategies will help us progress steadily in our pathway towards a Sustainable Sentosa.
