<h3><strong>Overview</strong></h3>
<p>The Sustainable Sentosa Framework was established to serve as one of SDC’s
key strategic thrusts. The framework promotes sustainability across SDC
and its subsidiaries’ operations, in line with national sustainability
initiatives to mitigate climate-related risks. The Sustainable Sentosa
Framework sits alongside other strategic imperatives, including SDC’s commitment
to guest satisfaction and ensuring their wellbeing and safety, while creating
a vibrant island economy and a nurturing and safe working environment for
all staff.</p>
<h4><strong>Our Vision</strong></h4>
<p>&gt; An internationally recognised resort island that offers an inspiring
sustainable development model that enables and furthers Singapore’s national
sustainability and climate change outcomes.</p>
<p>We also recognise the need to build networks to capitalise on synergies
to advance mutual interests in sustainability. Through forming meaningful
partnerships we can build a Sustainable Sentosa community to punch above
our weight in terms of impact and influence.</p>
<p>We believe that the supporting strategies will help us progress steadily
in our pathway towards a Sustainable Sentosa.</p>
