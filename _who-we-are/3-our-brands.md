Sentosa launched its latest brand campaign in May 2014 and unveiled a new tagline - The State of Fun, in a significant move aimed at positioning Singapore’s iconic resort destination as the capital of fun for everyone.

The campaign is created to refresh the popular island resort’s brand image and heighten its emotional connection with Singaporeans and foreign guests, as they come to the island to enjoy its many leisure offerings and build fun memories with their friends and families.
The brand tagline The State of Fun forms the basis for the island’s marketing communications, from the promotion of its attractions, events and programming to its service delivery style. The brand tagline’s bubbly, pop colour design also reflects the energetic pulse of the island and bursts of fun experiences on Sentosa.
