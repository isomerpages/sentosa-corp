Sentosa unveiled the tagline - 'Where discovery never ends' in Jan 2023, in a significant move aimed at offering both local and international guests new ways of discovering new experiences and celebrating connections on Sentosa.

The new brand identity sees the island taking centre stage and reflects Sentosa’s efforts to better connect with its audiences through leisure experiences that play up the island’s natural attributes, while offering guests a breadth of moments and emotions for them to discover on their own.

The new tagline draws inspiration from the island’s many unexpected sights, sounds, and experiences and conveys a promise of the myriad of offerings and sense of renewed self that awaits its guests to discover and experience, with every visit.
