#### **Sentosa<sup>TM</sup>, where discovery never ends, is Singapore’s premier island resort getaway and Asia’s leading leisure destination.**

Formerly a fishing village and British military base during World War II, Sentosa (meaning peace and tranquillity in Malay), was transformed into an idyllic island resort in 1972 as a recreational space for Singaporeans to enjoy. Today, Sentosa has become a premier leisure destination welcoming both local and international visitors from all around the world. 

This 500-hectare resort island is home to an exciting array of themed attractions, award-winning spa retreats and resort accommodation, alongside lush greenery, golden sandy beaches, world-renowned championship golf courses and even a deep-water yachting marina and luxury residences - making it a compelling destination for business and leisure for millions of visitors from all around the world. Sentosa is also home to Singapore’s first integrated resort, Resorts World Sentosa, which operates Southeast Asia’s first Universal Studios theme park.

Unique among leisure destinations, Sentosa is situated on the fringe of Singapore’s city centre, just minutes away from the central business district. The island is easily accessible via various modes of transport including the Sentosa Express from VivoCity and the Singapore Cable Car Sky Network which offers an aerial view of the HarbourFront precinct. Visitors can also choose to take a leisurely stroll into the island via the Sentosa Boardwalk.

### **Sentosa Development Corporation**


Sentosa Development Corporation (SDC) was established on 1 September 1972 as a Statutory Board under the Ministry of Trade and Industry. Its charter since inception has been to oversee the development, management, marketing and promotion of the island of Sentosa as a resort destination for locals and tourists. 

As part of its business subsidiaries, SDC oversees Sentosa Cove, Sentosa Golf Club and Mount Faber Leisure Group. SDC also owns Singapore’s only cable car sky network which connects from mainland Singapore to Sentosa and across the island to its western end at Siloso Point. 

Situated on the eastern end of Sentosa Island, Sentosa Cove, is an exclusive oceanwaterfront and residential enclave bustling with some 2,500 homes, quayside restaurants, retail and specialty shops. The island is also proud to be home to Sentosa Golf Club and its two acclaimed golf courses, The Serapong and The New Tanjong, with a number of high-profile professional and amateur tournaments being hosted at the club, including the Singapore Open and HSBC Women’s World Championship.

As a testament to its commitment to sustainability, SDC has been conferred with the Global Sustainable Tourism Council – For Destinations (GSTC-D) certificate, making Sentosa the first island destination in Asia to receive this accolade.
