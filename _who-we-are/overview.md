<h3><strong>Sentosa<sup>TM</sup>, where discovery never ends, is Singapore’s premier island resort getaway and Asia’s leading leisure destination.</strong></h3>
<p>Formerly a fishing village and British military base during World War
II, Sentosa (meaning peace and tranquillity in Malay), was transformed
into an idyllic island resort in 1972 as a recreational space for Singaporeans
to enjoy. Today, Sentosa has become a premier leisure destination welcoming
both local and international visitors from all around the world.</p>
<p>This 500-hectare resort island is home to an exciting array of themed
attractions, award-winning spa retreats and resort accommodation, alongside
lush greenery, golden sandy beaches, world-renowned championship golf courses
and even a deep-water yachting marina and luxury residences - making it
a compelling destination for business and leisure for millions of visitors
from all around the world. Sentosa is also home to Singapore’s first integrated
resort, Resorts World Sentosa, which operates Southeast Asia’s first Universal
Studios theme park.</p>

Singapore’s city centre, just minutes away from the central business district.
The island is easily accessible via various modes of transport including

which offers an aerial view of the HarbourFront precinct. Visitors can
also choose to take a leisurely stroll into the island via the Sentosa
Boardwalk.</p>
