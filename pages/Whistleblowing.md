#### **4. Anonymity**
<table class="WBpage_style">
  <tr>
    <td>4.1</td>
    <td>
      SDC recognizes that whistleblowers may wish to raise a concern either anonymously or in confidence under this Policy. However, in order to effectively evaluate and               investigate a concern, we encourage whistleblowers to identify themselves, where possible, to facilitate the appropriate and necessary follow-up clarifications. The             strictest confidentiality will be maintained and only those involved in the investigation will know the whistleblower’s identity.

    <td>
      If a whistleblower request that their identity be protected, SDC-IAD will not disclose it without consent, subject to any legal requirements to the contrary. Under certain       circumstances, SDC may be under obligation to reveal the whistleblower’s identity to parties such as lawyers, the police or investigators.
