For your convenience, we may also display to you data that you had previously supplied us or other Government Agencies. This will speed up the transaction and save you the trouble of repeating previous submissions. Should the data be out-of-date, please provide us with the latest data.

##### **3. SPECIFIC ISSUES FOR THE DISCLOSURE OF PERSONAL DATA TO THIRD PARTIES**

3.1 We respect the confidentiality of the personal data you have provided to us.

3.2 In that regard, we will not disclose your personal data to third parties without first obtaining your consent permitting us to do so. However, please note that we may disclose your personal data to third parties without first obtaining your consent in certain situations, including, without limitation, the following: 

(a) cases in which the disclosure is required or authorized based on the applicable laws and/or regulations; 

(b) cases in which the purpose of such disclosure is clearly in your interests, and if consent cannot be obtained in a timely way; 

(c) cases in which the disclosure is necessary to respond to an emergency that threatens the life, health or safety of yourself or another individual; 

(d) cases in which the disclosure is necessary for any investigation or proceedings; 

(e) cases in which the personal data is disclosed to any officer of a prescribed law enforcement agency, upon production of written authorisation signed by the head or director of that law enforcement agency or a person of a similar rank, certifying that the personal data is necessary for the purposes of the functions or duties of the officer; and/or 

(f) where such disclosure without your consent is lawful. For example, we may share personal data with other Government Agencies pursuant to a data sharing direction under the Public Sector (Governance) Act 2018.

3.3 Where we disclose your personal data to third parties, we will employ our best efforts to ensure all appropriate contractual arrangements and security mechanisms are in place to protect your personal data.

##### **4. REQUEST FOR ACCESS AND/OR CORRECTION OF PERSONAL DATA**

4.1 You may request to access and/or correct the personal data currently in our possession or control by submitting a written request to us at dataprotectionofficer@sentosa.com.sg. We will need enough information from you in order to ascertain your identity as well as the nature of your request, so as to be able to deal with your request. 

4.2 For a request to access personal data, once we have sufficient information from you to deal with the request, we will seek to provide you with the relevant personal data within 30 days. Where we are unable to respond to you within the said 30 days, we will notify you of the soonest possible time within which we can provide you with the information requested. 

4.3 For a request to correct personal data, once we have sufficient information from you to deal with the request, we will: 
(a) correct your personal data within 30 days. Where we are unable to do so within the said 30 days, we will notify you of the soonest practicable time within which we can make the correction; and 

(b) send the corrected personal data to every other organisation to which the personal data was disclosed by SDC within a year before the date the correction was made, unless that other organisation does not need the corrected personal data for any legal or business purpose.

4.4 We may also be charging you a reasonable fee for the handling and processing of your requests to access your personal data. We will provide you with a written estimate of the fee we will be charging. Please note that we are not required to respond to or deal with your access request unless you have agreed to pay the fee.

##### **5. REQUEST TO WITHDRAW CONSENT**

5.1 You may withdraw your consent for the collection, use and/or disclosure of your personal data in our possession or under our control by writing in to us at dataprotectionofficer@sentosa.com.sg. 

5.2 We will process your request within a reasonable time from such a request for withdrawal of consent being made, and will thereafter not collect, use and/or disclose your personal data in the manner stated in your request.

5.3 However, your withdrawal of consent could result in certain legal consequences arising from such withdrawal. In this regard, depending on the extent of your withdrawal of consent for us to process your personal data, it may mean that we will not be able to continue with your existing relationship with us.

##### **6. ADMINISTRATION AND MANAGEMENT OF PERSONAL DATA**

6.1 We will take reasonable efforts to ensure that your personal data is accurate and complete, if your personal data is likely to be used by SDC to make a decision that affects you, or disclosed to another organisation. However, this means that you must also update us of any changes in your personal data that you had initially provided us with. We will not be responsible for relying on inaccurate or incomplete personal data arising from you not updating us of any changes in your personal data that you had initially provided us with.

6.2 We will also put in place reasonable security arrangements (including policies, processes, and safeguards) to ensure that your personal data is adequately protected and secured. Appropriate security arrangements will be taken to prevent any unauthorized access, collection, use, disclosure, copying, modification, leakage, loss, damage and/or alteration of your personal data. This includes, but not limited to, systematic training for SDC personnel handling personal data, storing data in an encrypted manner where applicable, restricting access to personal data to authorised personnel only, and robust monitoring and oversight to ensure proper personal data management. However, we cannot assume responsibility for any unauthorized use of your personal data by third parties which are wholly attributable to factors beyond our control.

6.3 We will also put in place measures such that your personal data in our possession or under our control is destroyed and/or anonymized as soon as it is reasonable to assume that: 
(a) the purpose for which that personal data was collected is no longer being served by the retention of such personal data; and 
(b) retention is no longer necessary for any other legal or business purposes.

6.4 Where your personal data is to be transferred out of Singapore, we will take appropriate steps to ascertain that the foreign recipient organisation of the personal data is bound by legally enforceable obligations to provide to the transferred personal data a standard of protection that is at least comparable to the data protection standards that SDC is subject to. This may include us entering into an appropriate contract with the foreign recipient organisation dealing with the personal data transfer or permitting the personal data transfer without such a contract if it is lawful for us to do so.
