   <p>Being Asia’s leading leisure destination, Sentosa is known for its diverse array of unique leisure experiences today, ranging from themed attractions and dining offerings, to beaches, nature trails and accommodation options. As we move into the next phase of our development, we will build on this strong position to rejuvenate our offerings, including rolling out the landmark Sentosa-Brani Master Plan, which will redevelop the two islands into a game-changing leisure and tourism destination.<span id="dots">...</span>
<span id="more"> <br> An integral design principle of these plans is sustainable development. Even as we refresh our offerings amid changing guest preferences and needs, we remain firmly committed to environmental sustainability and protecting our island charm, and will ensure that the plans are sensitive to our rich nature and heritage.
   <br><br>To ensure that development works are done in an environmentally-sound manner, SDC and our Island Partners (tenants) have undertaken Environmental Impact Assessments (EIA) prior to such works. The purpose of these assessments is to identify, evaluate, and where necessary, mitigate the possible impacts of development projects.
  <br><br>The EIA process is conducted in consultation with stakeholders such as nature groups, technical agencies and relevant Government agencies. The EIA Reports published are open for public feedback for 4 weeks starting from the date of publication. We welcome your feedback at <a href="mailto:sustainability@sentosa.com.sg">sustainability@sentosa.com.sg</a></span></p>
